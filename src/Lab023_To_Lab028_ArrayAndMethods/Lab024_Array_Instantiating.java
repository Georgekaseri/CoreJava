      /*
        Instantiating an Array in Java
When an array is declared, only a reference of an array is created.
To create or give memory to the array, you create an array like this:
The general form of new as it applies to one-dimensional arrays appears as follows:

data type-name = new type [size];

Here, type specifies the type of data being allocated, size determines the number
of elements in the array, and var-name is the name of the array variable that is
linked to the array. To use new to allocate an array, you must specify the type
and number of elements to allocate.

Example:

declaring array
int intArray[];
allocating memory to array
intArray = new int[20];
combining both statements in oneint[]
intArray = new int[20];
       */




    }
}
